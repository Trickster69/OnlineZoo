        <h2 class="about-item__name">This is Gabriel Tovar, 45 years old</h2>
        <div class="about-item__dicr">An avid family man.
            He spends all his free time as an engineer with his wife and children.
            His children are simply delighted with any fluffy animals, it is not always possible to take children to the zoo and he needs 
            some alternative way to satisfy the interests of his sons. Watching broadcasts with cute pandas and funny monkeys together, 
            periodically feeding them with the help of small donations, would perfectly fit into their joint leisure.</div>

        <div class="about-item__dicr">Studying in the Czech Republic as a zoologist and working as a veterinarian among his friends and acquaintances.
            While doing homework, she likes to put videos or broadcasts with animals in the background, so it is calmer and more pleasant for her to study. After all, how can you not love these very different, but very interesting creatures? Often she needs to study the behavior and life of animals in the modern world, and when there is a service with which you can interact with the animals almost directly by feeding them with the help of small donations, this can save her time in which she will need to get to the nearest zoo, in which soon all, you can't give them food on your own and watch this, Zoo Online will come to her aid and decorate her life and rest.</div>
